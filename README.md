1. The screen size was increased to be 800 by 600

2. The monkey was made to move around the screen based off of the difficulty the user selects from the start menu

3. I kept the score in the main class and is located under the for event in pg.event.get() depending if the user hit or missed the monkey

4. The game pause menu can be activated by pressing P and will contiue the gameplay if the user presses C

5. The difficulty settings were put in a while inmenu() loop and changes based off of what key is pressed (1-5)

6. (MISSED)

7. (MISSED)

8. (MISSED)

9. The sound will play a voice that says miss when you miss the monkey. I just went to a text to speech site that would allow me to download the .wav

10. The background music was taken from the free sound website and plays only when in the game and pauses when the user pauses the game

11. Added percentages to the random movements to increse the randomness of events when passed over a certain percentage i.e over 75% x axis is flipped
